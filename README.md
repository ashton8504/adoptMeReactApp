Adopt Me React App Built with Frontend Masters Course on React

Description
This project is a React application that was built during a pair coding session with Brian Holt of Frontend Masters. The app incorporates various concepts and tools discussed during the session to demonstrate their practical implementation.

Concepts Covered
The coding session covered several important concepts and tools related to React development. Some of the key topics discussed include:

Components: The app utilizes the component-based architecture of React to build reusable and modular UI elements.

NPM: The Node Package Manager (NPM) is used for managing project dependencies and facilitating the installation of required packages.

Prettier: Prettier is a code formatter that ensures consistent and clean code formatting throughout the project.

ESLint: ESLint is a popular linter that helps identify and fix common coding errors or stylistic issues.

Vite: Vite is a fast and lightweight development server used to quickly set up React projects with modern build tooling and features like hot module replacement.

JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows the mixing of HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to define React components.

Hooks: React Hooks are used to add stateful behavior and lifecycle methods to functional components, making it easier to manage component state and side effects.

Effects: React Effects allow performing side effects such as fetching data or subscribing to events in functional components.

Custom Hooks: Custom Hooks enable the extraction of reusable logic from components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Handling User Input: The app demonstrates techniques for handling user input, such as form submissions and capturing user interactions.

React Dev Tools: React Dev Tools is a browser extension that provides additional debugging and inspection capabilities for React applications.

React Router: React Router is a library used for declarative routing in React applications, allowing navigation between different views.

React Query: React Query is a data-fetching library that simplifies fetching, caching, and updating remote data in React applications.

Uncontrolled Forms: The project explores the concept of uncontrolled forms in React, where form inputs manage their own state.

Class Components: Although the focus of the project is on functional components, class components are briefly discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of React development.

Error Boundaries: The concept of error boundaries is introduced to gracefully handle and display errors in React applications.
